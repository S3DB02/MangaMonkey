## Problem
Over the years, digesting written content online has become the norm. Reading different genres like books, news, comics, and mangas on a computer of some sort is the preferred way by many. For those, there are plenty of websites to consume your preferred type of content. But not a lot of them have progress trackers built-in. Especially regarding comic and manga consumption, it can be quite confusing to keep track of your progress because usually multiple books are being read. Readers either have to rely on third-party software to track their reading progress or track it by hand.

## Solution
This project aims to solve that problem by consolidating the two into one uniform website for avid manga readers. This project aims to host one of the biggest internet's manga databases powered by Mangadex. Also, the focus of this project is to have a page-precise progress tracking system built-in. One of the possible features is to have a favorites list or personal library others can inspect.

## Techonology Choice
One of this project's goals is to stay relevant in the future for both users and maintainers. That idea had a major role in the technological stack choice for this project. For the backend, Node.js was chosen for its speed of development and ease of maintainability due to oversaturation of JavaScript developers in the developer community. For the frontend, React was picked because of its popularity and abundance of documentation and amount of packages aimed at extending functionality. In terms of infrastructure, it is planned for this project to be scalable and extensible in the future, so some sort of containerization is required. Docker fits this requirement perfectly, not because of its core functionality but the tooling built around it.
